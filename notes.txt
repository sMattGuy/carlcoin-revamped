sanity
 sanity now works based on a scale from -100 to 100
 going below -100 sanity will cause the user to die with a penalty
 sanity is capped at 100 and users with positive sanity recieve benefits
 having less than 0 sanity starts causing debuffs

commands
 work: exactly like before, working normalizes you (moves sanity towards 0) has a 6 hour cool down
